# CryptoAIS - *Crypto Trade Calculator* 🧮

## Overview 🕶️

**CryptoAIS** is a lightweight and powerful tool designed to automate **capital gain calculations on cryptocurrency trades**. It extracts trade data from **AIS Crypto CSVs** (downloaded from the [E-Filing Portal](https://eportal.incometax.gov.in/)) and directly fills the required details into your **Form-16 Excel template**.

This eliminates the need for manual entry and speeds up the filing process, especially for crypto traders who need to reflect their gains accurately in income tax filings.

> [!WARNING]
The software is created for **Pooja ITR Centre**, and is publicly available for use, but the Excel sheets like ITR-Format and Form-16 are kept private. Therefore, these sheets are not shared with this or any other software.
